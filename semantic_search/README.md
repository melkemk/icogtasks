# Semantic Search Project

## Overview
This project implements a semantic search engine that leverages natural language processing (NLP) techniques to provide more accurate and relevant search results. Currently, the project uses a dataset of fewer than 500 entries, which may limit its performance. Future updates will focus on expanding the dataset and improving the search algorithms to enhance accuracy and relevance.

## Features
- **Natural Language Processing**: Uses advanced NLP techniques to understand the context and semantics of search queries.
- **High Accuracy**: Provides highly relevant search results by understanding the intent behind the queries.
- **Scalability**: Designed to handle large datasets efficiently.
