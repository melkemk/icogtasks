# SNN-BA (Samadi et al., 2017)

This circuit implements the spiking neural model of (Samadi et al., 2017) [1].
Specifically, this model is **supervised** and can be used to process sensory
pattern (row) vector(s) `x` to predict target (row) vector(s) `y`. This class offers,
beyond settling and update routines, a prediction function by which ancestral
projection is carried out to efficiently provide label distribution or regression
vector outputs. Note that "SNN" denotes "spiking neural network" and "BA"
stands for "broadcast alignment". This class model it does not feature a separate
`calc_updates()` method like other models since its `settle()` routine
adjusts synaptic efficacies dynamically (if configured to do so).

The SNN-BA is graphically depicted by the following graph:

```{eval-rst}
